Example 6
Question: What does the internal cavity contain?
Ground Truth: a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles; a pharynx ("throat"); a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach; and a system of internal canals.
Predicted: The internal cavity contains the mouth, pharynx, stomach, roots of the tentacles, all along the underside of each comb row, and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth. It is lined with an epithelium called the gastrodermis. The gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies. The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells, germ cells, and photocytes, while the side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells, ciliary rosettes, pores, and double whorls of cilia.
