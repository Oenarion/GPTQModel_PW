Question: How are packets normally forwarded
Ground Truth: by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing
Predicted: There are two types of packet switching: the first one is the traditional method of packet forwarding, which is done by the network nodes (e.g. routers) in a star topology network. The other one is the asynchronous method, which is done by the network nodes (e.g. routers) in a star topology network.

    Background: The traditional method of packet forwarding is done by the network nodes (e.g. routers) in a star topology network. This method is based on the first-in, first-out (M1F1) method.

    In the traditional method, the first node in the network (e.g. the node that is going to the next node in the network) has to make a decision to decide which of the
