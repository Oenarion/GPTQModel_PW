Example 3
Question: What happens secondly if a Directive's deadline is not met?
Ground Truth: a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company
Predicted: Context: First, if a Directive's deadline for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action (so called "vertical" direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could "not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails." Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a "general principle" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company. In the case of the UK's privatised water company, Severn Trent Water, the Court of Justice held that the Directive could be invoked by the company against its employees, as it was a public service. Fourth, a Directive can be invoked by a company against its employees, even if the company is not a state. In the case of the UK's privatised water company, Severn Trent Water, the Court of Justice held that the Directive could be invoked by the company against its employees, as it was a public service. Fifth, a Directive can be invoked by a company against its employees, even if the company is not a state. In the case of the UK's privatised water company, Severn Trent Water

Question: What does the internal cavity contain?
Ground Truth: a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles; a pharynx ("throat"); a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach; and a system of internal canals.
Predicted: The internal cavity contains the mouth, pharynx, stomach, roots of the tentacles, all along the underside of each comb row, and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth. It is lined with an epithelium called the gastrodermis. The gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies. The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells, germ cells, and photocytes, while the side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells, ciliary rosettes, pores, and double whorls of cilia.
