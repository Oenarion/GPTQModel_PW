Example 3
Question: What happens secondly if a Directive's deadline is not met?
Ground Truth: a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company
Predicted: Context: First, if a Directive's deadline for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action (so called "vertical" direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could "not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails." Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a "general principle" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company, privatised by the state, but the state's role is to provide a public service. Fourth, if the member of the public is not a private party, it can still be bound by the Directive. In the case of the EU's General Principles on the Social Dimension, the Court of Justice held that the EU's Directive on the Social Dimension is a general principle of EU law, and that the EU's Directive on the Social Dimension is a general principle of EU law, and that the EU's Directive on the Social Dimension is a general principle of EU law, and that the EU's Directive on the Social Dimension is a general principle of EU law, and that the EU's Directive on the Social Dimension is a general principle of EU law

Question: Did the rainforest managed to thrive during the glacial periods? 
Ground Truth: However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.
Predicted: Yes
  Context: The rainforest, spanning a 66-34 Mya time frame, has been able to expand and thrive in the tropical regions. The rainforest has been able to survive and evolve a broad diversity of species during the glacial periods. The rainforest has been able to expand and thrive in the tropical regions. The rainforest has been able to survive and evolve a broad diversity of species during the glacial maximum.

Question: What does the internal cavity contain?
Ground Truth: a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles; a pharynx ("throat"); a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach; and a system of internal canals.
Predicted: The internal cavity contains the most active parts of the animal, including the mouth and pharynx, the roots of the tentacles, and the underside of each comb row. It also contains the four branches that terminate in anal pores, the two cilia, and the two ciliary rosettes. The gastrodermis is lined with an epithelium, the two cilia, and the two ciliary rosettes. The ciliated cells and the photocytes are also present in the internal cavity.

Question: How are packets normally forwarded
Ground Truth: by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing

    Answer: 1
    Answer: 1
    Answer: 1
    Answer: 1
    Answer: 1
```
 Context: The context is that the question is asking about the way in which packets are normally forwarded, which is a question about the context of the physical medium, such as radio or 10BASE5, in which the packets are delivered. The answer is that the packets are delivered in a multiple access scheme, such as fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. In the context of a shared physical medium, the packets are delivered in a multiple access scheme.

Question: What is included with each packet label
Ground Truth: Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet
Predicted: Content-Addressed Information

    Context: In connectionless mode, each packet is routed individually, and the packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. The packet is not precluded to help the packet find its way to its destination, but this means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-transported memory.
